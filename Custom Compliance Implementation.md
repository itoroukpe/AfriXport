## **USA Customs Compliance Implementation Plan for AfriXport**

To establish robust customs compliance for the U.S. import market, AfriXport will adopt a phased approach focused on infrastructure, vendor onboarding, operational workflows, and continuous improvement.

### **Phase 1: Core Infrastructure & Database Expansion**

* Develop a comprehensive customs documentation system to support all U.S. import requirements.
* Implement an HTS (Harmonized Tariff Schedule) code management module with automated product classification.
* Create USA trade lane–specific data tables for tracking compliance milestones and document status.
* Build a customs bond management feature for single-entry and continuous bond tracking.
* Enable shipper/importer of record (IOR) designation functionality for vendors, buyers, or AfriXport.

---

### **Phase 2: USA-Specific Vendor Onboarding**

* Launch a structured U.S. trade lane onboarding checklist (based on AfriXport documentation).
* Add a product classification workflow with HTS code selection and validation.
* Integrate compliance screening tools (e.g., OFAC sanctions, import restrictions).
* Implement document validation workflows for FDA, USDA, and EPA-regulated products.
* Introduce an export readiness scoring system to assess vendor eligibility for the U.S. market.

### **Phase 3: Shipment & Customs Processing Workflow**

* Integrate Importer Security Filing (ISF) capabilities to support ocean freight compliance ("10+2" requirements).
* Automate commercial invoice generation using transaction-level data.
* Establish integration with licensed U.S. customs brokers for seamless filing.
* Develop a duties and taxes calculator based on HTS classification and Incoterms.

* Set up automated alerts for regulatory changes affecting product categories or trade rules.
* Connect to customs classification APIs for real-time HTS code validation.
* Provide advanced analytics and reporting for customs performance, cost breakdowns, and compliance trends.
