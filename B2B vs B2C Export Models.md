# **AfriXport Training Guide: B2B vs. B2C Export Models**

---

## **1. What Is B2B? (Business-to-Business)**

* Selling from one business to another (e.g., a Nigerian shea butter producer exporting 5 tons to a cosmetics manufacturer in the U.S.).
* Transactions are **large-scale**, wholesale.
* Contracts and **negotiated terms** (pricing, shipping, payment).

**Export Requirements for B2B:**
✅ **Company registration** and tax ID.
✅ **Commercial Invoice** (detailed value & buyer info).
✅ **Packing List** (quantities, packaging details).
✅ **Bill of Lading/Air Waybill** (from carrier).
✅ **Certificate of Origin** (to prove product origin).
✅ **Export License** (if commodity requires one).
✅ **Quality/Compliance Certificates** (ISO, FDA, Organic, Fairtrade, etc. depending on buyer demand).
✅ **Insurance documents** (for larger shipments).

*Key Point for Champions:* B2B requires **heavier compliance** and professional-level documentation because it’s often regulated and involves customs clearance at scale.

## **2. What Is B2C? (Business-to-Consumer)**

* Selling directly from a business to **end consumers** (e.g., AfriXport vendor shipping 2 Ankara dresses to a customer in London).
* Transactions are **small-scale**, retail.
* Standardized pricing (no heavy negotiations).

**Export Requirements for B2C:**
✅ **Commercial Invoice** (simpler, itemized for small orders).
✅ **Customs Declaration Form** (CN22/CN23, depending on weight/value).
✅ **Waybill/Shipping Label** (via courier like UPS, DHL, EMS, FedEx).
✅ **Return/Refund Policy** (required for consumer sales in EU/US/UK).
✅ **Consumer Protection Compliance** (e.g., labeling requirements for textiles, food packaging standards).

*Key Point for Champions:* B2C requires **lighter documentation**, but vendors must comply with **retail import rules** in the buyer’s country (like FDA for food or CE label for products in Europe).

## **4. AfriXport Champion Talking Points**

* ✅ Explain to vendors: **B2B = bulk, more paperwork. B2C = retail, lighter paperwork but consumer laws apply.**
* ✅ Vendors must **decide which model they want to pursue** (some may do both).
* ✅ AfriXport supports **both models**, but documentation will differ.
* ✅ Remind vendors: **Non-compliance leads to delays, fines, or returned goods.**
