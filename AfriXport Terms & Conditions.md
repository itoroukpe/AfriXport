# AfriXport Terms & Conditions (Excerpt: Vendor Compliance)

### 1. Role of AfriXport

AfriXport operates as an online marketplace that connects vendors (exporters) with buyers (importers). AfriXport is **not a carrier, freight forwarder, customs broker, or importer of record**. AfriXport does not take ownership of goods, nor is AfriXport responsible for securing export/import licenses, shipping documentation, or customs clearance.

### 2. Vendor Responsibilities

By registering and listing products on AfriXport, each vendor agrees to:

* **Export Licenses & Permits:** Secure and maintain all necessary export licenses, permits, and authorizations required to ship their products to the buyer’s country.
* **Customs Compliance:** Accurately classify products using applicable Harmonized System (HS) codes and provide all required customs documentation (commercial invoices, packing lists, certificates of origin, etc.).
* **Product Certifications:** Ensure all products meet the legal, regulatory, and certification requirements of the importing country (e.g., health, safety, labeling, agricultural, or environmental certifications).
* **Trade Restrictions:** Comply with all applicable sanctions, embargoes, and restricted party lists. Vendors shall not list or ship any product prohibited by international trade law or the laws of the origin/destination country.
* **Accuracy of Information:** Provide true, accurate, and complete product descriptions, pricing, and compliance details at the time of listing.

### 3. Buyer Responsibilities

Buyers are responsible for:

* Obtaining any necessary **import permits, licenses, or approvals** required by their country.
* Paying all **customs duties, tariffs, VAT, taxes, and other charges** applicable to the import of goods.
* Ensuring that the products purchased comply with their local laws and standards.

### 4. AfriXport’s Limited Liability

* AfriXport does not guarantee that any product listed on the platform complies with export or import regulations.
* AfriXport shall not be held liable for any fines, penalties, seizures, delays, or losses resulting from a vendor’s or buyer’s failure to comply with applicable trade laws.
* Vendors and buyers agree to indemnify and hold AfriXport harmless from any claims, liabilities, or damages arising out of non-compliance.

### 5. Shipping & Logistics

* Vendors may choose to arrange shipping directly with buyers or through AfriXport’s third-party logistics partners.
* In all cases, the vendor remains the **Exporter of Record (EOR)**, and the buyer remains the **Importer of Record (IOR)**.
* AfriXport’s role is limited to facilitating the connection and providing digital tools to support trade transactions.

### 6. Termination for Non-Compliance

AfriXport reserves the right to suspend or terminate any vendor account that fails to comply with these obligations, provides false or misleading compliance information, or engages in prohibited trade activities.

---

✅ This makes it **crystal clear**: vendors (not AfriXport) are responsible for **licenses, customs, and certifications**.
✅ It also protects AfriXport legally by disclaiming liability.

Would you like me to **expand this into a full Terms & Conditions document** (with sections on payments, dispute resolution, intellectual property, prohibited items, etc.), or do you want this **compliance-focused addendum** to slot into your existing T\&Cs?
