---
Absolutely. The **Local Champion Program** is a strategic feature that empowers **trusted individuals or small businesses in key regions** to serve as **AfriXport ambassadors and operational partners**. They act as **boots-on-the-ground agents** who onboard, verify, and support service vendors (like tailors, architects, repair techs, etc.) across different cities, states, or countries.

This program builds **trust, accessibility, and quality assurance** into the service platform ‚Äî especially crucial in Africa and other emerging markets where digital trust is still growing.

## üß± **1. What is a Local Champion?**

A Local Champion is a vetted and trained **AfriXport affiliate/partner** who is responsible for:

* **Sourcing and onboarding local service providers**
* **Verifying identity, business legitimacy, and service quality**
* Providing **hands-on support and onboarding** (forms, photos, training)
* Serving as a **liaison** between vendors and AfriXport central ops
* **Earning commissions** or bonuses per vendor or service transaction

---

## üîß **2. Functional Implementation Overview**

Here‚Äôs how the Local Champion Program works in practice:

### A. **Champion Roles & Permissions**

Define a new role:

* Role: `"local_champion"`
* Permissions:

  * Add/edit vendor profile
  * Upload verification documents/photos
  * Approve/reject vendor onboarding requests in region

| üßæ **Form Upload**           | ID, CAC/business license, proof of service                           |
| üìä **Performance Dashboard** | Track how many vendors onboarded, job completion rate, quality score |
| üí¨ **Support Chat**          | Contact admin, report fraud, troubleshoot onboarding                 |
| üí∞ **Payout Module**         | View commission earned per vendor onboarded or per booking enabled   |
