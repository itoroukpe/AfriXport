✅ This version:

* Protects AfriXport legally.
* Clearly makes **vendors and buyers responsible for compliance**.
* Covers **payments, dispute resolution, IP, prohibited items, and liability**.

Would you like me to also **draft a simplified Vendor Agreement** (a separate contract vendors must sign before listing products), or should this full T\&Cs document alone serve as the binding agreement at launch?
