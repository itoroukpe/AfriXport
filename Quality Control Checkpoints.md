## How Quality Control Checkpoints Works

Based on the code analysis, here's how the Quality Control system is designed to work:

### **System Overview:**
1. **Order-Based QC**: The system fetches orders with status `'processing'` or `'ready_to_ship'` that belong to the current vendor
2. **Predefined Checkpoints**: Six default quality checkpoints are automatically applied to each order:
   - Visual Inspection (required, needs photo)
   - Functional Testing (required)
   - Dimensions & Measurements (optional, needs photo + measurements)
   - Packaging Quality (required, needs photo)
   - Documentation Review (required)
   - Compliance Verification (required)

### **QC Workflow:**
1. **Session Creation**: Orders needing QC appear as "sessions" 
2. **Start QC**: Vendor clicks "Start QC" to begin inspection
3. **Checkpoint Evaluation**: For each checkpoint, vendor can:
   - Mark as Pass/Conditional/Fail
   - Upload photo evidence (if required)
   - Add measurements (if required)
   - Write inspection notes
4. **Completion**: System calculates overall score (pass rate %)
   - â‰¥80% = Order moves to "ready_to_ship"
   - <80% = QC fails, order needs review

### **Current Issues:**
The system expects:
- Orders with `vendor_id` field populated
- Orders in `processing` or `ready_to_ship` status
- A `save-qc-results` edge function (which may not exist)

To enable you to properly evaluate the Quality Control Checkpoints system, I need to create comprehensive test data including:

1. **Create Test Orders for QC Evaluation**:
   - Orders with `vendor_id` pointing to the current user
   - Orders in `processing` status (ready for QC)
   - Associated order items with product names
   - Realistic shipping addresses and order details

2. **Create Varied QC Scenarios**:
   - Orders with different complexity levels
   - Orders with different product types (to test various checkpoints)
   - Orders that would pass QC (>80% pass rate)
   - Orders that would fail QC (<80% pass rate)

3. **Create Supporting Edge Function**:
   - Implement the missing `save-qc-results` edge function
   - Handle QC result storage and order status updates
   - Provide proper error handling and logging

4. **Test Data Scenarios**:
   - **Scenario A**: Simple single-item order (should pass QC easily)
   - **Scenario B**: Multi-item order (moderate complexity)
   - **Scenario C**: Complex order with measurement requirements (challenging QC)
   - **Scenario D**: Order with potential compliance issues (may fail QC)

This will give you a complete testing environment to evaluate:
- QC session initiation and management
- Individual checkpoint evaluation
- Photo upload functionality
- Measurement recording
- Overall scoring and pass/fail logic
- Order status transitions after QC completion

Create comprehensive QC test data and missing edge function
