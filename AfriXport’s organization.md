To strategically structure AfriXport’s organization, ownership, and fundraising plan, we’ll address the following areas:

---

## ✅ **1. Company Ownership Structure (100%)**

| Stakeholder Group                     | Percentage | Notes                                                          |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Founder (You)                         | 40%        | Retain majority influence and long-term strategic control      |
| Board of Directors                    | 20%        | 6 Directors; equity split (e.g., 3.33% each)                   |
| External Investors                    | 20%        | Targeted for \$10,000 operational funding                      |
| Company Reserve (ESOP & Reinvestment) | 20%        | Reserved for reinvestment, staff incentives, or future scaling |

## ✅ **2. Capital Raising Plan**

| Fundraising Source | Target Amount | Use of Funds                                            |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Directors Equity   | \$6,000       | Platform infrastructure (e.g., hosting, APIs, licenses) |
| Investor Equity    | \$10,000      | Marketing, legal, operations, vendor onboarding, etc.   |

**Note**: These contributions can be structured as **equity-based funding** proportional to the share allocations, or as **convertible notes** with equity conversion clauses.

## ✅ **3. Suggested Board Structure**

| Role                    | Key Responsibilities                                              |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Chairperson             | Governance oversight, fundraising strategy, alignment             |
| CTO / Tech Advisor      | Technical roadmap, architecture oversight                         |

## ✅ **4. Equity Allocation Example for Directors (20%)**

To encourage buy-in and fair participation:

| Director Role         | Equity % | Option: Buy-in Value |
| --------------------- | -------- | -------------------- |
| Chairperson           | 4%       | \$1,200              |
| CTO                   | 4%       | \$1,200              |
| CFO                   | 4%       | \$1,200              |
| Legal Advisor         | 2.5%     | \$750                |
| Marketing Advisor     | 2.5%     | \$750                |
| Logistics/Ops Advisor | 3%       | \$900                |
| **Total**             | **20%**  | **\$6,000**          |

This buy-in structure aligns incentives and brings accountability.

* **Convertible Notes/SAFE (for Investors)** – if not selling direct equity
