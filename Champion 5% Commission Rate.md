## **Champion 5% Commission Rate – Explained**

The **5% commission rate** represents the portion of AfriXport’s commission that is paid to Local Champions for the vendors they onboard and support. This model is designed to reward champions for actively contributing to vendor success on the platform.

---

### **How the Commission Works**

1. **Source of Earnings**
   Champions earn a share from the **commission fees that AfriXport collects** on vendor sales.

2. **Champion’s Share**
   Specifically, they receive **5% of the total commission** collected from vendors they have onboarded.

3. **Activity-Based Payments**
   Champions are compensated for both onboarding and ongoing vendor support activities.

---

### **Example Scenario**

If a vendor (onboarded by a champion) makes \$1,000 in sales:

* **AfriXport earns a commission**: 8% of \$1,000 = **\$80**
* **Champion earns 5% of AfriXport’s commission**: 5% of \$80 = **\$4.00**

> Note: The commission percentage charged to vendors may vary by product category.

### **Champion Earnings Breakdown**

Champions can earn through several sources:

1. **Vendor Onboarding**

   * One-time commission when a new vendor is successfully onboarded.

2. **Ongoing Vendor Support**

   * Lead generation
   * Initial vendor outreach
   * Document collection and review
   * Onboarding assistance
   * Vendor verification and updates

3. **Performance-Based Activities**

   * All completed tasks and earnings are tracked in the `champion_activities` database table.

### **Payment Schedule & Process**

* **Frequency**: Monthly payouts
* **Processing Time**: Payments are processed within **5–7 business days** after the end of each month
* **Thresholds**: Minimum payout thresholds may apply

---

### **Monthly Earnings Example**

If a champion onboards 10 vendors who generate \$50,000 in total monthly sales:

* **AfriXport’s Commission (8%)**: \$4,000
* **Champion’s Share (5%)**: \$200/month

> Actual earnings may vary depending on:

* The number of vendors onboarded
* Total vendor sales volume
* Product category commission rates
* Quantity and quality of completed support activities

This structure ensures that champions are rewarded for both vendor acquisition and long-term vendor success, encouraging sustained engagement and platform growth.
