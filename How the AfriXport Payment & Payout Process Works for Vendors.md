# How the AfriXport Payment & Payout Process Works for Vendors

At AfriXport, we use an **escrow system** to protect both buyers and vendors. This ensures that buyers have confidence in their purchases, while vendors can trust they’ll be paid once orders are fulfilled.

Here’s the step-by-step process from the time a customer pays until your money is released to you:

---

### **1. Customer Purchase & Payment**

* A buyer adds your product to their cart and checks out.
* They choose a payment method: **Stripe (instant card payment)** or **Bank Transfer (ACH/SEPA/Wire, takes 1–3 days)**.
* Once payment is made, the order is created in our system.

**What this means for you:**

* You get notified that a customer has placed and paid for an order.
* The money is **securely held in escrow** (not released yet).

---

### **2. Payment Verification & Escrow Hold**

* AfriXport verifies the buyer’s payment.
* The order status updates to **“Confirmed”**.
* Our system automatically sets aside:

  * **8% commission fee** for AfriXport
  * **92% payout** reserved for you

**What this means for you:**

* You know the payment is verified and reserved.
* Your payout is guaranteed once the order is delivered.

---

### **3. Order Fulfillment by Vendor**

* You process the order and ship the product to the buyer.
* You update shipping details and tracking information in your dashboard.
* The order status changes: **Confirmed → Processing → Shipped**.

**What this means for you:**

* The buyer can track their package.
* You’re one step closer to payout.

---

### **4. Delivery & Escrow Release**

* Once the buyer receives the order, they confirm delivery.
* AfriXport’s admin team reviews the order and releases the funds from escrow.

**What this means for you:**

* Your payout becomes **“Ready”** for transfer.
* The order status updates to **Delivered**.

---

### **5. Final Vendor Payout**

* AfriXport transfers the funds directly to your registered bank account.
* You’ll see the transfer details and payout confirmation in your dashboard.
* Processing time: **1–3 business days** depending on your bank.

**What this means for you:**

* You receive your earnings (92% of the sale price, after commission).
* All commission records and transfers are stored in your account for full transparency.
