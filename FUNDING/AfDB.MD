## 1. Background and Problem Statement

Nigeria possesses one of Africa’s largest concentrations of **smallholder farmers, micro-enterprises, artisans, and light manufacturers**, yet a significant portion remain **excluded from regional and global markets** due to structural barriers.

Key challenges include:

* Fragmented access to international buyers
* Limited export readiness (certifications, standards, documentation)
* High cost and complexity of compliance and logistics
* Weak aggregation and market linkage mechanisms
* Limited digital infrastructure connecting SMEs to demand

These challenges suppress income generation, job creation, and value-addition across agriculture, manufacturing, fashion, and cultural industries—despite strong global demand for African products.
