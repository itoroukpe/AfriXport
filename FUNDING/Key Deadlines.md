## 📌 **How to Use This Calendar**

1. **Track rolling AfDB & trust fund calls** — especially *AfTra* and other trade-focused vehicles — by bookmarking AfDB’s proposals portal and subscribing to alerts. ([AFDB][1])
2. **Monitor the SME Support Centre portal weekly** for new calls that can fund trade, export, SME scaling initiatives. ([SME Support Centre][3])
3. **Apply to region-wide programs** (e.g., TEEP, Qualcomm) to build capacity, networks, and early funding traction while you prepare larger mid-size proposals. ([Opportunities For Africans][5])
4. **Draft and maintain concept notes** for each key funder so you can respond quickly when calls are announced.

---

## 📄 Next Steps (What I Can Create for You)

I can now build **fully tailored proposals** for these specific funders:

### ✅ **1. African Development Bank (AfDB)**

A tailored proposal aligned with:

* **Africa Trade Fund (AfTra)** priorities
* AfDB High 5 goals (trade, industrialization, SME growth)
* AfCFTA integration and regional export scaling

### ✅ **2. SheTrades / ITC Funding Program Proposal**

SheTrades often supports export-focused initiatives and women-inclusive value chains — and while it doesn’t always have open grant rounds, we can prepare a **proposal template** that can be adapted upon call announcements. ([SME Support Centre][3])

### ✅ **3. Prosper Africa Engagement Proposal**

Prosper Africa is not a classic grant program; it is a **USG trade and investment initiative**. I’ll tailor a **trade partnership and operational plan** that qualifies AfriXport for Prosper Africa support services, buyer match facilitation, and potential USG trade funding windows.

---

## 📌 To Proceed I Need Just a Bit More Info

Please confirm:

1. **Your organization status**

   * Is AfriXport incorporated in Nigeria (legal business)?
   * If yes, what is the entity type (LLC, Ltd, NGO, etc.)?

2. **Primary priority segment** you want to fund first:
   A. Agriculture vendors & export readiness
   B. Mixed export operations (agri + manufacturing + arts)
   C. Digital trade platform scaling & buyer acquisition

Reply with A, B, or C — and I’ll generate **customized proposal drafts** promptly for AfDB, SheTrades, and Prosper Africa.

These constraints limit export participation, income growth, and job creation despite strong global demand for African products.
