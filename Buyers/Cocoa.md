Here are several of the main *potential cocoa buyers* in the U.S. and Canada — companies and types of companies that buy raw cocoa beans or cocoa products. Depending on what you mean by “cocoa” (beans, powder, processed ingredients, etc.), different buyers are relevant. If you tell me which kind you mean (raw beans, processed, organic, fair-trade, etc.), I can narrow further.
